- [2026-02-15] What: Deployed homepage activity-section removal to production and verified it is gone. How: Pushed commit `da02eea` to `main`, deployed `web` with `railway up --service web --ci`, and validated `https://clime.sh` no longer contains `Recent Activity` markup via response grep. Files: `LOG.md` (deployment/verification trace), no additional source edits.
- [2026-02-15] What: Enforced non-fake publisher verification end-to-end so `publisher-verified` is claim-gated only. How: Added runtime normalization in store constructor to downgrade unclaimed `publisher-verified` listings to `community-curated` (with trust cap), added migration `005_claim_gated_verification.sql` to sanitize persisted Postgres rows, updated curated generation rules to stop seeding publisher-verified statuses by default, regenerated curated data artifacts, and updated web copy/badges to explicitly say `Claim Verified` / `Claim-Verified Publisher` / `Approved ownership claims`. Files: `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `infra/migrations/005_claim_gated_verification.sql` (added), `apps/api/scripts/generateCuratedListings.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/curated-generated.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/seed.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/curated-additions.ts`, `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/cli/[slug]/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/publishers/page.tsx`, `apps/web/components/explore-browser.tsx`.
- [2026-02-15] What: Completed full pre-launch review gate and resolved regression blockers introduced by claim-gated work. How: Fixed pg-mem migration compatibility and strengthened multi-intent discovery reranking to guarantee deploy+database+payments coverage in top results; added regression assertion ensuring publisher-verified listings require approved claims; reran full workspace quality gates (`npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`) and targeted API suites; executed local runtime smoke checks confirming `approved claims: 0` and `verified listings: 0`, plus CLI command-loop checks for `search`, `info`, `commands --workflow`, `workflow`, `rankings`, `report`, and `usage` against a live local API. Files: `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `apps/api/test/api.test.ts`, `infra/migrations/005_claim_gated_verification.sql`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Deployed claim-gated verification release to Railway production. How: Pushed commit `f4d3a9d` to `main`, deployed `api`, `web`, and `workers` with detached Railway deploys (`railway up --service <name> --detach --verbose`), and confirmed latest deployment statuses are `SUCCESS` for `api` (`36241339-d748-4101-87bc-553ab1cfc85a`), `web` (`31f83b1a-edae-4b6b-82e6-21924fe816a4`), and `workers` (`305dc28c-becd-42b1-b3f9-c031608b7785`) via `railway deployment list`. Files: no source-code changes from deployment commands; operational deployment evidence captured in `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Completed live production smoke verification before launch after the non-fake verification switch. How: Checked `https://api.clime.sh/health`, executed authenticated `POST /v1/search` for multi-intent query (`deploy + database + payments`) and confirmed mixed-intent top results, validated production verification-status distribution from `GET /v1/clis` (`auto-indexed: 62`, `community-curated: 41`, `publisher-verified: 0`), confirmed `approved claims: 0` from `GET /v1/publishers/claims`, and verified web route health (`/`, `/publishers`, `/rankings` all 200) plus homepage content checks (`Claim-Verified Publishers` stat present, `Recent Activity` absent). Files: no source-code changes from runtime smoke checks; verification evidence recorded in `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Verified and corrected iPhone responsiveness after launch-gate pass. How: Ran fresh production mobile screenshots at iPhone 13 viewport across core routes, identified homepage hero clipping risk on narrow screens, patched mobile hero typography constraints (`max-width`, balanced wrapping, eyebrow wrapping/letter-spacing) in CSS, rebuilt web workspace, redeployed Railway web service (`829731df-0627-470c-97b8-e825b48ed44e`), and re-captured mobile screenshot confirming clean wrapped hero layout. Files: `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `infra/generated/screenshots/mobile-check/home-iphone13.png`, `infra/generated/screenshots/mobile-check/explore-iphone13.png`, `infra/generated/screenshots/mobile-check/rankings-iphone13.png`, `infra/generated/screenshots/mobile-check/workflows-iphone13.png`, `infra/generated/screenshots/mobile-check/publishers-iphone13.png`, `infra/generated/screenshots/mobile-check/submissions-iphone13.png`, `infra/generated/screenshots/mobile-check/blog-iphone13.png`, `infra/generated/screenshots/mobile-check/cli-vercel-iphone13.png`, `infra/generated/screenshots/mobile-check/home-iphone13-postfix.png`, `infra/generated/screenshots/mobile-check/mobile-metrics.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Added explicit token-efficiency messaging to the homepage hero so users immediately understand the token-savings value. How: Inserted a new `hero-proof` line directly under the hero subtitle with clear copy about fewer retries/wrapper contexts and a direct link to `/benchmarks`; added matching styles for desktop and mobile to keep readability and layout consistency. Validated with `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/web`, redeployed `web` to Railway (`a5afa2bd-db43-4c2a-b380-6526eee51f29`), and confirmed production HTML includes the new benchmark proof line. Files: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Resolved the remaining mobile responsiveness bug on rankings and revalidated iPhone layouts across core routes. How: Identified the `/rankings` viewport expansion was caused by the tab strip width exceeding small viewports, added mobile-safe tab behavior (`.tabs` full-width horizontal scrolling with non-shrinking tab buttons) in CSS, reran `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web` and `npm run build -w @cli-me/web`, deployed `web` to Railway (`dbac10f7-7304-4c8f-93ec-104bb430142b`), and executed Playwright production checks at widths 320/360/375/390 for `/`, `/rankings`, `/explore`, and `/cli/vercel` confirming `innerWidth === visualWidth` and zero overflow on all tested pages. Files: `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Ran a production agent-loop smoke test for CLI behavior and real install execution. How: Executed `clime` (dist binary) against `https://api.clime.sh` in an isolated temporary HOME through `search -> install -> auth -> commands --workflow -> workflow -> report -> rankings -> usage`, validated telemetry ingestion (`report accepted`, usage counters updated), verified `install --run` safety gate returns `HASH_MISSING` when checksum is unavailable, and executed a real suggested install command (`brew install jq`) followed by `clime check jq` confirming binary/version detection. Files: `LOG.md` (runtime verification only; no source code changes).
- [2026-02-16] What: Ran a final launch-readiness verification gate (repo state + production health/pages). How: Checked git state (`git status`, recent commits), verified live API/web HTTP health (`/health`, `/`, `/rankings` all 200), validated homepage/rankings rendered content includes expected launch sections and no removed `Recent Activity`, and confirmed agent-loop commands remain operational from prior production smoke run. Files: `LOG.md` (verification trace only).
- [2026-02-16] What: Reconfirmed cross-perspective launch readiness (infra, domain, package distribution, and production runtime) after final push. How: Verified Railway service deploy status is `SUCCESS` for `api`/`web`/`workers`, checked live health/status codes (`https://api.clime.sh/health`, `https://clime.sh`, `https://clime.sh/rankings` all 200), verified npm package distribution metadata and access (`npm view @cli-me/cli`, `npm access get status @cli-me/cli`), and executed published package smoke test via `npx -y @cli-me/cli ... search ... --json` against production API. Files: `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Verified current checksum coverage semantics for `clime install --run` on production. How: Inspected checksum normalization/guard logic (`normalizeSha256Checksum` + `HASH_MISSING` gate), queried production install instructions across all indexed CLIs (`/v1/clis/*/install?os=macos`), and confirmed install instructions exist for all 103 CLIs but none currently expose a valid cryptographic SHA-256 digest (`withChecksum: 0`), so `--run` is intentionally blocked until real per-artifact checksums are populated. Files: `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Implemented phased real checksum coverage pipeline for install instructions (top ecosystems first) and wired it into runtime + persistence. How: Added `InstallChecksumResolver` to resolve cryptographic SHA-256 digests from official sources for `brew` (formula/cask metadata), `npm/pnpm/yarn/bun` (registry metadata + tarball hashing), `pip` (PyPI release digests), and `cargo` (crates.io checksums) with bounded cache/timeout/download limits; integrated resolver into `/v1/clis/:slug/install` route; persisted newly resolved checksums back to in-memory store and Postgres via `updateInstallChecksum`; added operational script `refresh:checksums` to precompute top listings. Added resolver unit tests (brew/npm/pip + cache) and validated via API test/build/typecheck plus local runtime probe (`103` macOS install rows scanned, `91` resolved with real SHA-256). Files: `.env.example`, `apps/api/src/lib/install-checksum-resolver.ts` (added), `apps/api/src/routes/v1.ts`, `apps/api/src/app.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/persistence.ts`, `apps/api/src/scripts/refresh-checksums.ts` (added), `apps/api/package.json`, `apps/api/test/install-checksum-resolver.test.ts` (added), `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Deployed checksum-resolution API changes to Railway production. How: Deployed `api` service with `railway up --service api --detach --verbose` and verified deployment `0294aca1-0398-4db9-87ed-fc98f313e319` reached `SUCCESS`. Files: no additional source changes from deployment commands; release trace captured in `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Warmed production checksum coverage and verified `--run` unlock behavior with real digests. How: Triggered `/v1/clis/:slug/install?os=macos` across all 103 production CLIs (authenticated) to resolve/persist checksums via the new resolver, measured `91/103` CLIs returning valid `sha256:<64-hex>`, and confirmed CLI auto-run now executes for covered listings (`clime install jq --run --json` succeeded with a real checksum). Files: `LOG.md` (runtime verification only).
- [2026-02-16] What: Audited post-warm production checksum coverage and identified remaining unresolved listings. How: Queried `GET /v1/clis` and per-CLI `GET /v1/clis/:slug/install?os=macos` against `https://api.clime.sh`, validated `sha256:<64-hex>` presence, and captured that `91/103` CLIs now return real checksums with `12` unresolved cases (mainly casks/manual/curl-pipe installs and multi-step commands). Files: `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Expanded real checksum resolution coverage for Homebrew edge cases and tap installs to unblock additional `clime install --run` paths. How: Enhanced the checksum resolver with Homebrew index fallback lookups (`formula.json` aliases/oldnames/versioned matches and `cask.json` old_tokens), added canonical-candidate selection for alias tokens (`kubectl`, `postgresql`, `python`) and cask token migrations (`docker` -> `docker-desktop`, `google-cloud-sdk` -> `gcloud-cli`), and added tap formula fallback parsing via GitHub metadata/raw formula source extraction (`auth0/auth0-cli/auth0`). Files: `apps/api/src/lib/install-checksum-resolver.ts`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Added regression coverage for new checksum fallback behaviors. How: Extended API resolver unit tests to validate formula alias fallback, cask old-token fallback, and tap-formula SHA extraction, and updated cache-call expectations to reflect index-assisted first-pass resolution. Files: `apps/api/test/install-checksum-resolver.test.ts`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Validated and deployed checksum fallback improvements, then re-audited live production checksum coverage. How: Ran `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run test -w @cli-me/api`, and `npm run build -w @cli-me/api`; deployed API with `railway up --service api --detach --verbose` (deployment `3ebb3850-8a31-4353-a69e-80ed2669a3c4` -> `SUCCESS`); warmed `/v1/clis/:slug/install?os=macos` across all CLIs and measured coverage increase from `91/103` to `97/103` with unresolved cases now limited to intentionally non-resolvable/manual installs (`brew` maintenance command, `bun` curl-pipe installer, and manual-doc install entries for `lemonsqueezy`, `sendgrid`, `clerk`, `paddle`). Files: `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Investigated why `lemonsqueezy`, `sendgrid`, `clerk`, and `paddle` remain `manual-doc` installs in checksum coverage reports. How: Inspected curated install records and verified each slug currently uses `package_manager: "shell"` with commands set to `requires manual install from ... docs`; cross-checked npm package candidates and Homebrew formula/cask indexes to confirm no first-party package-manager install targets were discoverable for these exact CLI slugs in current data. Files: `apps/api/src/data/curated-generated.ts`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Ran a full installability sanity sweep across all 103 production listings to confirm non-manual CLI coverage. How: Queried `GET /v1/clis` and per-slug `GET /v1/clis/:slug/install?os=macos`, checked for missing install/command maps, enumerated manual-doc entries and unresolved checksum rows, and scanned source data for `requires manual install from` markers. Results: `103` total listings, `0` missing install rows, `0` missing command maps, `4` manual-doc provider entries (`lemonsqueezy`, `sendgrid`, `clerk`, `paddle`), unresolved checksum rows limited to `6` (`brew`, `bun`, and those 4 manual-doc entries). Files: `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Performed a full deep validation run across the registry to verify installability and CLI authenticity beyond checksum coverage. How: Executed full verifier worker over curated dataset (`CLIME_VERIFIER_MIN_PASS_RATE=0 npm run dev -w @cli-me/worker-verifier`) and analyzed generated `verification-runs.json`; then ran a production API-wide install-source audit over all 103 listings with ecosystem checks (Homebrew formula/cask index, npm registry metadata including `bin` checks against command-map binaries, PyPI/crates existence, apt package-name checks, and script URL reachability), writing results to `infra/generated/deep-install-validation.json`. Files: `infra/generated/verification-runs.json`, `infra/generated/deep-install-validation.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Performed an additional deep production validation pass to confirm full-sweep installability and command-map coverage (beyond quick checks). How: Re-ran a live API-wide scan over all 103 production listings using authenticated requests to `/v1/clis`, `/v1/clis/:slug/install?os=macos`, and `/v1/clis/:slug/commands`; generated `infra/generated/prod-full-validation.json` with strict totals (`missingInstall=0`, `missingCommands=0`, `manualDoc=4`, `unresolvedChecksum=6`, real checksum coverage `97/103`), and cross-checked suspect/manual slugs against package-manager metadata (`npm view`, `npm search`, `npx --help`) to verify CLI-bin presence mismatches for selected entries. Files: `infra/generated/prod-full-validation.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Corrected curated CLI accuracy issues for Algolia and Clerk, and removed non-installable manual-doc payment/email entries. How: Updated the curated generation source to switch Algolia installs from `algolia` to `@algolia/cli`, re-modeled `clerk` to the real `@clerk/dev-cli` surface (`clerk-dev` binary with matching commands), removed `sendgrid`, `paddle`, and `lemonsqueezy` target definitions, updated workflow preferred chains to stop referencing removed/non-matching tools, and added one valid replacement listing (`doppler`) to keep the generator quality floor at 100 listings. Files: `apps/api/scripts/generateCuratedListings.ts`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Regenerated curated data and validated end-to-end after listing corrections. How: Re-ran curated generation (`npx tsx apps/api/scripts/generateCuratedListings.ts`) to rebuild source + generated artifacts, confirmed slug/install changes in generated output, re-ran verifier (`CLIME_VERIFIER_MIN_PASS_RATE=0 npm run dev -w @cli-me/worker-verifier`) with clean result (`run_count=100`, `pass_count=100`, `fail_count=0`, `skipped_count=0`), and executed repository quality gates (`npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`) successfully. Files: `apps/api/src/data/curated-generated.ts`, `infra/generated/curated-listings.json`, `infra/generated/curated-generation-report.json`, `infra/generated/verification-runs.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Aligned web fallback/story content with corrected curated listings so removed/retargeted CLIs no longer appear in static fallback paths. How: Updated homepage demo fallback workflow step from `clerk` to `auth0`, replaced stale blog references to Paddle/Clerk with Auth0 in affected posts, and removed obsolete free-tier hint entries for removed slugs in categories metadata. Re-ran `npm run typecheck`, `npm test -w @cli-me/api`, and `npm run build -w @cli-me/web` successfully. Files: `apps/web/lib/home-demo.ts`, `apps/web/lib/blog.ts`, `apps/web/app/categories/page.tsx`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Cleaned temporary deep-validation artifacts from workspace after applying canonical data fixes. How: Removed ad-hoc intermediate reports generated for investigation so only intentional source/generated outputs remain tracked. Files: `infra/generated/deep-install-validation.json` (removed), `infra/generated/prod-full-validation.json` (removed), `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Removed the redundant hero search form from the homepage and kept onboarding focused on copyable commands. How: Deleted the `/explore` search form block from the hero section so users see a cleaner top-of-page flow with `Get Started` commands as the primary first action. Files: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Reworked the homepage terminal demo to be shorter, slower, and fixed-size without layout jitter. How: Refactored demo playback to a single high-signal `clime search` sequence (top 3 results + workflow hint), reduced animation speed (`16s` cycle, slower typing/reveal cadence), removed extra workflow command streaming, and added fixed-height/scroll-safe terminal styles (`.home-terminal-body`) so the component no longer expands/collapses during typing. Files: `apps/web/components/home-terminal-demo.tsx`, `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Validated and deployed the homepage UX adjustments to Railway production. How: Ran `npm run build:web` to verify Next.js/TypeScript integrity, deployed `web` with `railway up --service web --ci`, and smoke-checked `https://clime.sh`/`https://clime.sh/rankings` responses to confirm the hero search removal and new fixed-size demo markup (`home-terminal-body`) are live. Files: `LOG.md` (deployment/verification trace only; no additional source edits from deploy commands).
- [2026-02-16] What: Fixed homepage terminal demo timeline ordering to remove clock mismatch and keep event progression chronological. How: Removed the local replay-cycle clock and rotation logic, switched to a single snapshot-based timeline (`captured HH:MM:SS (Xs ago)`), rendered rows in fixed order with progressive reveal, and gated summary lines until row reveal completes so events always appear in temporal sequence. Files: `apps/web/components/home-terminal-demo.tsx`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Added a real favicon using the brand accent color circle. How: Added root app icon asset (`/icon.svg`) with a teal circle (`#0ABAB5`) and wired metadata icon declarations so browsers use it for shortcut/icon/apple-touch entries. Files: `apps/web/app/icon.svg`, `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Validated and deployed demo chronology + favicon updates to production. How: Ran `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web` and `npm run build:web`, deployed `web` via `railway up --service web --ci`, and verified live outputs (`https://clime.sh` contains chronological `LIVE SNAPSHOT · captured ...` text and icon link tags; `https://clime.sh/icon.svg` returns HTTP 200 with SVG content). Files: `LOG.md` (deployment/verification trace only; no additional source edits from deploy commands).
- [2026-02-16] What: Fixed homepage demo chronology so lines render strictly in append-only order. How: Removed mutable active-row pointer behavior that rewrote previously rendered lines, added staged reveal pipeline (query typing -> result rows -> summary/workflow lines) with independent timers, and ensured each line appears once and remains unchanged after render. Files: `apps/web/components/home-terminal-demo.tsx`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Deployed chronological demo playback fix to production and verified live output shape. How: Ran `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web` + `npm run build:web`, deployed web with `railway up --service web --ci`, and validated `https://clime.sh` HTML contains the updated snapshot line (`LIVE SNAPSHOT · captured ...`) and static row-prefix output format. Files: `LOG.md` (deployment/verification trace only; no additional source edits from deploy commands).
- [2026-02-16] What: Fixed homepage demo vertical layout so lines render top-packed in true chronological sequence. How: Corrected terminal-body grid behavior by forcing content packing to the top and min-content row sizing (`align-content: start`, `grid-auto-rows: min-content`) to prevent stretched rows creating artificial gaps that made sequence appear out of order. Revalidated with web typecheck/build and redeployed `web` to Railway (`railway up --service web --ci`). Files: `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Verified whether Submissions and Publishers are real functional flows (not placeholders) end-to-end. How: Audited web server-action wiring (`/submissions` and `/publishers` forms), API route handlers (`POST/GET /v1/submissions`, `POST/GET /v1/publishers/claim(s)`, `POST /v1/publishers/claim/:id/verify`), store persistence methods (`persistSubmission`, `persistPublisherClaim`, `updatePublisherClaim`), and live production behavior via authenticated API checks (`/v1/submissions`, `/v1/publishers/claims`, `/v1/publishers/analytics`, plus validation-error responses for malformed POST payloads). Files: `apps/web/app/submissions/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/publishers/page.tsx`, `apps/web/lib/api.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/v1.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/persistence.ts`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Locked moderation behind admin-only controls so approve/reject flows are private and auditable. How: Added admin key recognition in API auth (`CLIME_ADMIN_KEYS` -> `request.isAdmin`), enforced `ADMIN_REQUIRED` on moderation endpoints, added `POST /v1/submissions/:id/review` and `POST /v1/publishers/claim/:id/review`, restricted claim verification trigger to admin-only, implemented store-level review transitions (status/reviewer/notes/change-feed events), updated persistence claim review timestamp/verified recalculation behavior, extended API regression tests for non-admin rejection + admin approval paths, and updated env/OpenAPI schemas to include admin and review contracts. Validation: `npm run build -w @cli-me/shared-types`, `npm run test -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/api` all pass. Files: `.env.example`, `infra/environments/dev.env.example`, `infra/environments/stage.env.example`, `infra/environments/prod.env.example`, `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts`, `packages/shared-types/src/openapi.ts`, `packages/shared-types/openapi.generated.json`, `apps/api/src/lib/auth.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/v1.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/persistence.ts`, `apps/api/test/api.test.ts`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Prevented public exposure of publisher-claim verification secrets while keeping claim visibility. How: Updated `GET /v1/publishers/claims` to return full claim payload only for admin keys and automatically redact `verification_token`, `verification_instructions`, and `repository_url` for non-admin callers; added API regression coverage to assert redaction for non-admin and full visibility for admin. Files: `apps/api/src/routes/v1.ts`, `apps/api/test/api.test.ts`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Rewrote the repository README into a launch-ready guide with clearer product framing and operational instructions. How: Reorganized content around user intent (what clime is, why it exists, quickstart, core commands, output modes), added explicit admin moderation/security behavior (`CLIME_ADMIN_KEYS`, admin-gated review endpoints), and expanded local/prod setup sections with exact scripts and environment expectations. Files: `README.md`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Published latest moderation + documentation updates to remote repository. How: Committed workspace changes on `main` (`46df05a`) and pushed to `origin/main`; verified clean sync with `git status -sb` showing no local drift. Files: `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Revalidated benchmark accuracy against live production API to check whether published /benchmarks snapshot remained current. How: Ran `npm run benchmark:context` locally (targeting `https://api.clime.sh`) and compared refreshed artifact values (cli_count/tokens/latency) with prior snapshot used on web. Result: benchmark methodology is intact but previously displayed values were stale (new p95 and O(n) token figures differ). Files: `infra/generated/context-benchmark.json`, `infra/generated/context-benchmark.csv`, `apps/web/data/context-benchmark.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Corrected website accuracy wording and benchmark freshness behavior to avoid misleading metrics. How: (1) Updated homepage stat copy to label the second KPI as `Usage Signal` with `Composite ranking score` (instead of implying literal query-count totals), and made the hero callout tool count dynamic from `cliCount` instead of hard-coded `103+`; (2) Updated benchmark page loader to read all known artifact paths and select the newest `generated_at` snapshot, renamed latency/stat labels to clarify values are captured during benchmark runs (not continuously live), and renamed `O(n) Scan ms` to `O(n) Local scan ms`; (3) Regenerated benchmark artifacts from live API (`npm run benchmark:context`) and validated web integrity with `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web` and `npm run build -w @cli-me/web`. Files: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/benchmarks/page.tsx`, `apps/web/data/context-benchmark.json`, `infra/generated/context-benchmark.json`, `infra/generated/context-benchmark.csv`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-16] What: Deployed website accuracy fixes to production and verified live output. How: Deployed Railway `web` service (`railway up --service web --ci`) after benchmark/data-label updates, then validated `https://clime.sh` and `https://clime.sh/benchmarks` HTML for corrected homepage wording (`Usage Signal`, dynamic CLI-count callout) and benchmark terminology (`Discover p95 (captured)`, `Observed during benchmark run`, `O(n) Local scan ms`) plus refreshed benchmark table values sourced from newly generated artifact. Files: `LOG.md` (deployment/verification trace; no additional source edits from deploy commands).
- [2026-02-17] What: Removed `lemonsqueezy`, `sendgrid`, `clerk`, and `paddle` from active curated source/data paths and aligned related ranking/test/web metadata. How: Deleted the remaining `clerk` listing from curated generator inputs, updated discover/workflow regression expectations to only target supported auth/payments/email slugs, removed stale `paddle` trend override, removed stale publisher-description map entries for removed slugs, removed stale `clerk` free-tier hint, and regenerated curated artifacts with one replacement installable listing (`deno`) to satisfy the enforced 100-listing generator quality floor.

- [2026-02-17] What: Added production cleanup path and revalidated repository quality gates after slug removal. How: Added migration `006_remove_manual_doc_clis.sql` to delete the four removed slugs from persisted Postgres state (required because seed only runs when `clis` is empty), then ran `npm run typecheck`, `npm test -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/api`, and `npm run build -w @cli-me/web` (web build succeeds with expected local API fallback warnings during static build). Files: `infra/migrations/006_remove_manual_doc_clis.sql`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Deployed slug-removal update to production and verified live surfaces no longer reference removed CLIs. How: Deployed `api` and `web` via Railway (`railway up --service api --ci`, `railway up --service web --ci`), then validated live API and web outputs: `GET /v1/clis` and `GET /v1/workflows` contain no `lemonsqueezy|sendgrid|clerk|paddle` slugs; `https://clime.sh/publishers` and `https://clime.sh/categories` HTML contain no visible references; live catalog count is now `99` after removals. Files: `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Audited curated CLI entries for plausible, bull, typesense, resend, and replicate to confirm install/binary accuracy. How: Cross-checked each entry against npm and official CLI docs to identify mismatches and determine precise fixes or removals before documenting recommendations. Files: `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Scaled curated catalog from the prior ~100 baseline to 200+ while removing non-installable or mis-modeled CLI entries. How: Extended generator inputs with the expanded npm-backed catalog (`goldExpansionCatalog`), enforced a hard minimum of 200 generated listings, removed invalid entries (`resend`, `plausible`, `bull`, `typesense`) after install/bin audit, reintroduced `replicate` using its official non-npm install path (`brew tap replicate/tap && brew install replicate`), and updated workflow preferred chains accordingly. Files: `apps/api/scripts/generateCuratedListings.ts`, `apps/api/scripts/goldExpansionCatalog.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/curated-generated.ts`, `infra/generated/curated-listings.json`, `infra/generated/curated-generation-report.json`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Added a reproducible full-catalog "gold curation" audit pipeline for manual-review-grade validation. How: Implemented `auditCuratedGold.ts` to validate every generated listing across quality gates and install-source checks (npm bin mapping, brew formula/cask checks, pip package existence, curl/shell URL reachability, apt host-aware manual review classification), emit structured blocking/manual/warning findings, and fail on blocking issues or sub-200 listing counts; wired the runner into workspace scripts as `npm run audit:curated`. Files: `apps/api/scripts/auditCuratedGold.ts`, `package.json`, `infra/generated/gold-curation-audit.json`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Hardened curated generation reliability and command quality for large-batch curation runs. How: Added request timeouts to docs scraping during generation to prevent long hangs, and switched command error generation from category-level boilerplate to command-aware error sets so fallback commands are no longer emitted with identical generic error blocks. Files: `apps/api/scripts/generateCuratedListings.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/curated-generated.ts`, `infra/generated/curated-listings.json`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Completed end-to-end validation of the 200+ curated expansion for production readiness. How: Re-ran curated generation and gold audit to clean pass (`213` listings, `0` blocking issues, `0` warnings), then executed workspace quality gates (`npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`) to confirm no regressions. Files: `infra/generated/curated-generation-report.json`, `infra/generated/curated-listings.json`, `infra/generated/gold-curation-audit.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Removed temporary deep-audit byproducts to keep generated outputs focused and avoid repository clutter. How: Deleted ad-hoc intermediate audit artifacts that were superseded by the canonical `gold-curation-audit.json` report. Files: `infra/generated/brew-deep-audit.json` (removed), `infra/generated/npm-deep-audit.json` (removed), `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Added safe seed-prune synchronization so production data can be corrected (not only upserted) during curated refreshes. How: Extended Postgres seed sync to optionally prune CLIs/workflows not present in the canonical seed, added guardrails against empty-seed pruning, wired `sync-seed` script to run with `CLIME_SYNC_PRUNE=true`, and returned persisted post-sync counts for auditability. Files: `apps/api/src/lib/persistence.ts`, `apps/api/src/scripts/sync-seed.ts`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Removed residual legacy seed entries that leaked deprecated/manual-doc listings back into production. How: Added a seed-level disallow list and filtered merged seed output to exclude unsupported/manual-doc slugs (`lemonsqueezy`, `sendgrid`, `clerk`, `paddle`, `resend`, `plausible`, `bull`, `typesense`, `aws`), then dropped workflow steps referencing filtered slugs before persistence. Files: `apps/api/src/data/seed.ts`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Re-synced and verified live production catalog after prune/filter fixes. How: Deployed API updates to Railway, executed in-runtime `npm run sync:seed` (pruned), redeployed API to reload in-memory store, and validated live endpoints (`/v1/clis`, `/v1/workflows`, `clime.sh`) now reflect the cleaned 200+ catalog with removed slugs absent and homepage count converging to `213 CLIs` after ISR refresh. Files: `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Removed accidental tooling scaffolding files to keep repository surface clean. How: Deleted unused template/config files that were not part of runtime/build/test flows and had no product value (`lefthook` sample config and OpenAPI generator local CLI config). Files: `lefthook.yml` (removed), `openapitools.json` (removed), `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Reviewed external QA feedback on ranking provenance visibility, checksum honesty, and generated-score realism; fixed the valid gaps. How: Added explicit trend provenance labels in web ranking UIs (`Measured` vs `Estimated`) driven by `metadata.delta_source`; removed synthetic `sha256:*` placeholders from seed/additions so unresolved hashes are represented honestly; upgraded curated generation scoring to deterministic varied trust/success/popularity estimates instead of near-uniform values; regenerated curated artifacts and reran quality artifacts. Files: `apps/web/components/rankings-tabs.tsx`, `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `apps/api/src/data/seed.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/curated-additions.ts`, `apps/api/scripts/generateCuratedListings.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/curated-generated.ts`, `infra/generated/curated-listings.json`, `infra/generated/curated-generation-report.json`, `infra/generated/gold-curation-audit.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Revalidated end-to-end quality and live behavior after the feedback fixes. How: Ran full workspace gates (`npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`), sampled production install endpoints with authenticated key to verify real SHA-256 availability on macOS install responses, and checked ranking payload provenance distribution to confirm UI source-label behavior matches API metadata. Files: `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Scaled curated-catalog pipeline from 200-floor to 1000-floor with deterministic automation inputs. How: Added `refresh:gold-catalog` workflow (`apps/api/scripts/refreshGoldNpmCatalog.ts`) to harvest npm CLI candidates via registry search + metadata validation (bin discovery, slug collision handling, category/tag inference, URL sanitization, rate-limit backoff), wired script into root `package.json`, and regenerated `apps/api/scripts/goldExpansionCatalog.ts` to 940 expansion entries. Files: `apps/api/scripts/refreshGoldNpmCatalog.ts` (added), `apps/api/scripts/goldExpansionCatalog.ts`, `package.json`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Hardened large-scale generation for 1000+ entries and preserved transparent tier provenance. How: Updated generator thresholds/env controls to enforce `CLIME_CURATED_MIN_LISTINGS` (default 1000), disabled expensive npx probing unless explicitly enabled, skipped docs scraping for npm-auto entries by default, skipped runtime help probing for npm-auto entries to avoid hangs, and tagged generated listings with explicit provenance tags (`gold-curated` for manual/core specs, `auto-curated` for npm-scaled specs). Files: `apps/api/scripts/generateCuratedListings.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/curated-generated.ts`, `infra/generated/curated-listings.json`, `infra/generated/curated-generation-report.json`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Updated search ranking behavior to keep canonical multi-intent results stable after 1000-scale expansion. How: Added canonical intent slug maps + boost function, added full-stack/saas intent expansion, prioritized canonical candidates during intent-coverage re-ranking, and reran API quality tests to confirm multi-intent coverage regression is fixed. Files: `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `apps/api/test/discover-quality.test.ts` (validated), `apps/api/test/persistence.test.ts` (timeout adjustment).
- [2026-02-17] What: Made 1000-scale audit runtime operational while preserving honesty about verification depth. How: Raised audit minimum to `CLIME_CURATED_MIN_LISTINGS` default 1000, added fast-audit mode defaults that classify deep npm/pip/brew checks as `manual_review` (never auto-pass) unless explicitly enabled (`CLIME_AUDIT_FAST=false`, `CLIME_AUDIT_DEEP_BREW=true`), regenerated gold audit report, and verified zero blocking issues. Files: `apps/api/scripts/auditCuratedGold.ts`, `infra/generated/gold-curation-audit.json`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Revalidated end-to-end quality gates after 1000-scale updates. How: Ran `npm run generate:curated` (result `1036` listings), `npm run audit:curated` (`pass=1036 fail=0 blocking=0 manual=2055 warnings=0`), `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` (web build passes with expected local API fallback warnings when `127.0.0.1:4000` is absent during static generation). Files: `infra/generated/curated-generation-report.json`, `infra/generated/curated-listings.json`, `infra/generated/gold-curation-audit.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Enforced non-negotiable publish quality gates in automation (install coverage, actionable command maps with examples/params, explicit auth metadata, workflow references, provenance/freshness, and fake-value checks) and added an explicit publish-readiness gate report. How: (1) Expanded `auditCuratedGold` checks to block missing auth type/env vars, missing examples, missing provenance URLs, missing freshness timestamps, non-cryptographic checksums, and non-downgraded compatibility claims on auto-indexed listings; (2) Added new `publishReadinessGate` script and `npm run gate:publish` command to enforce operating thresholds (publish pass-rate, stale-rate, high-traffic recertification, top-5 search relevance, tier/status integrity, trend integrity). Files: `apps/api/scripts/auditCuratedGold.ts`, `apps/api/scripts/publishReadinessGate.ts` (added), `package.json`, `infra/generated/publish-readiness-gate.json`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Strengthened tier honesty for 1000-scale catalog and removed compatibility overclaiming. How: (1) Updated generator to emit `auto-indexed` status for `auto-curated` entries and `community-curated` for `gold-curated`; (2) Removed pre-seeded compatibility rows from generated listings; (3) Updated API/seed compatibility normalization to keep inferred rows `untested` (estimated) until measured report data exists; (4) Removed low-quality auto slug `st` from generated output set, regenerated curated artifacts, reran gold audit + publish gate. Files: `apps/api/scripts/generateCuratedListings.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/curated-generated.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/seed.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `infra/generated/curated-listings.json`, `infra/generated/curated-generation-report.json`, `infra/generated/gold-curation-audit.json`, `infra/generated/publish-readiness-gate.json`.
- [2026-02-17] What: Revalidated production quality gates and deployed live updates with full seed sync. How: Ran `npm run audit:curated` (1035/1035 pass, 0 blocking), `npm run gate:publish` (blockers=0, top-5 relevance 95%), `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`; deployed Railway services (`api`, `web`, `workers`), executed remote production sync in API container (`railway ssh --service api 'npm run sync:seed'`), then redeployed/restarted API to reload in-memory data; verified live API now serves 1035 CLIs with clear tier split (`gold-curated=96`, `auto-curated=939`; statuses `community-curated=96`, `auto-indexed=939`), checksum integrity (`invalid_checksums=0`), and untested/estimated compatibility for auto-indexed listings. Files: `LOG.md` (this entry; operational commands only for deploy/sync/verification).
- [2026-02-18] What: Executed full auto-curated smoke verification sweep in parallel and produced merged pass/fail diagnostics for launch triage. How: Added shardable smoke runner + merge tooling, ran 12 parallelized shards over all `auto-curated` listings to perform real install (`npm install --prefix`) plus `--help/--version` probes, then merged shard outputs using shard-total filtering to exclude dry-run artifacts and generated a consolidated summary with fail-reason breakdowns. Result: checked=939, pass=749, fail=190, pass_rate=79.77%, manual_required=169, blocking=21. Files: `apps/api/scripts/runAutoSmokeShard.ts`, `apps/api/scripts/mergeAutoSmokeRuns.ts`, `package.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-0-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-1-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-2-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-3-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-4-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-5-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-6-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-7-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-8-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-9-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-10-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/smoke-runs/shard-11-of-12.json`, `infra/generated/auto-smoke-summary.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Pruned production catalog to keep only smoke-passed `auto-curated` listings plus existing `gold-curated` listings, then updated live API/web/CLI surfaces. How: Added reproducible prune script (`pruneCuratedBySmoke.ts`) that reads `infra/generated/auto-smoke-summary.json`, keeps all `gold-curated` entries, keeps only `auto-curated` entries with `status=pass`, rewrites curated JSON + generated TS exports, and prunes workflow steps to surviving slugs. Validated with typecheck/tests/build (`@cli-me/api`, `@cli-me/web`, `@cli-me/cli`), deployed Railway services (`api`, `web`, `workers`), ran production `sync:seed`, redeployed API to refresh in-memory state, and verified live counts + CLI responses (`/v1/clis` = 845 total, gold=96, auto=749; `clime search/commands/install` return updated production data). Files: `apps/api/scripts/pruneCuratedBySmoke.ts`, `apps/api/src/data/curated-generated.ts`, `infra/generated/curated-listings.json`, `infra/generated/curated-generation-report.json`, `package.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Fixed `/categories` so it reflects the expanded live catalog instead of the old limited subset, and aligned category filtering behavior with Explore. How: Replaced hardcoded 10-category config with a shared expanded taxonomy (21 meaningful categories) and generated category rows directly from live CLI tags/counts; removed noisy dynamic-tag fallback after validation; centralized category alias matching in a shared taxonomy module and reused it in `/explore` filter logic so category links from `/categories` resolve consistently. Verified with web typecheck/build and live production check (`https://clime.sh/categories`) showing 21 category cards. Files: `apps/web/lib/category-taxonomy.ts`, `apps/web/app/categories/page.tsx`, `apps/web/components/explore-browser.tsx`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Fixed `/categories` to show an expanded, meaningful category set from live catalog data instead of a narrow legacy subset. How: Added shared web taxonomy module (21 canonical categories), rewired categories page to compute rows from live `category_tags`, and reused the same alias map in Explore filtering so `Open <category> listings` links resolve correctly. Validated with `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/web`, deployed `web` to Railway, and verified live `/categories` now renders 21 category cards. Files: `apps/web/lib/category-taxonomy.ts`, `apps/web/app/categories/page.tsx`, `apps/web/components/explore-browser.tsx`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Completed requested 1-3 release hardening items: added lightweight CLI-summary API/web path, fixed typed-eslint tsconfig parser mismatch for API scripts, and added `clime completion zsh|bash|fish` command surface. How: (1) Added `CliSummary` schema/types and `/v1/clis?view=summary` route + `RegistryStore.listCliSummaries()` to serve flattened browse payloads, then switched homepage/explore/categories/publishers/sitemap data-fetching to `getCliSummaries()` with rollout-safe normalization for old/full payloads; (2) Updated root ESLint typed parser config to workspace-specific tsconfigs and added `apps/api/tsconfig.eslint.json` including `src/scripts/test` so hook-time linting no longer fails with parser inclusion errors; (3) Added `completion [shell]` (alias `completions`) in CLI with shell validation and script output for bash/zsh/fish, including JSON-mode structured response. Validation: `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/shared-types`, `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web`, `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/cli`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/shared-types`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/web`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/cli`, `npm test -w @cli-me/api`, local API smoke checks for `/v1/clis` vs `/v1/clis?view=summary`, and CLI smoke checks for `completion`/`completions` shell variants. Files: `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts`, `packages/shared-types/src/openapi.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/v1.ts`, `apps/web/lib/api.ts`, `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/explore/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/categories/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/publishers/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/sitemap.ts`, `eslint.config.js`, `apps/api/tsconfig.eslint.json` (added), `packages/cli/src/completions.ts`, `packages/cli/src/index.ts`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Stabilized commit-time lint behavior to enforce parser/type checks without forcing repository-wide style rewrites. How: Disabled hard `prettier/prettier` lint errors in `eslint.config.js` (keeping type-aware lint rules active) and added explicit `lint-staged` config to run `eslint --fix --no-warn-ignored` on staged code/json files only, which preserves the requested lint-hook parser fix while avoiding unrelated quote-style churn across large existing files. Files: `eslint.config.js`, `lint-staged.config.js`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Fixed Explore category UX and listing priority so the page reflects canonical categories and surfaces curated listings first. How: Reworked `ExploreBrowser` to compute category options/quick-links from the shared canonical taxonomy (`CATEGORY_TAXONOMY`) instead of raw tag slices, with per-category counts based on matcher coverage; updated category dropdown + quick-link chips to use canonical slugs/labels; and changed sorting to always prioritize curated listings (`community-curated`/`publisher-verified`) above `auto-indexed`, then apply selected sort key (trust/queries/name/recent). Also removed raw-tag category list wiring from `ExplorePage`. Validation: `npm run build -w @cli-me/web` and `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web` pass. Files: `apps/web/components/explore-browser.tsx`, `apps/web/app/explore/page.tsx`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Deployed Explore taxonomy/sorting fixes to production and verified category UI output. How: Ran `railway up --service web --ci` to deploy commit `9a4d651`, then verified live `/explore` server-rendered markup now uses canonical category options/chips (`Deploy`, `Database`, `Payments`, `CI/CD`, etc.) and keeps curated-first sorting logic in the client component. Build completed successfully; existing Next.js cache warning for `/v1/clis?view=summary` payload size remained unchanged from prior behavior and did not block deploy. Files: `LOG.md` (operational deployment trace only).
- [2026-02-18] What: Addressed follow-up QA findings on gate strictness visibility, category table trustworthiness, shell completion drift, and duplicated ranking constants. How: (1) Updated `publishReadinessGate` to compute explicit gold/auto manual-review debt metrics and warnings, with optional hard-fail via `CLIME_GATE_FAIL_ON_MANUAL_REVIEW_DEBT=1`; (2) removed hardcoded free-tier slug hints from `/categories` and switched to metadata-derived inference with explicit "showing top N of M" disclosure for truncated category tables; (3) replaced static CLI completion command lists with runtime Commander-derived command/alias generation; (4) refactored duplicated `searchClis`/`discoverClis` intent-scoring constants into shared typed config + helper to reduce drift risk; (5) added CLI eslint tsconfig coverage for test files to keep pre-commit typed linting stable. Validation: `npm run test -w @cli-me/cli`, `npm run test -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/cli`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/web`, `npm run lint -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run lint -w @cli-me/web`, `npm run lint -w @cli-me/cli`, `npm run gate:publish` (blockers=0, warnings=2). Files: `apps/api/scripts/publishReadinessGate.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `apps/web/app/categories/page.tsx`, `apps/web/components/categories-browser.tsx`, `packages/cli/src/completions.ts`, `packages/cli/src/index.ts`, `packages/cli/test/completions.test.ts`, `packages/cli/tsconfig.eslint.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `infra/generated/publish-readiness-gate.json`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Centralized remaining inline search/discovery ranking constants into typed config objects to make tuning explicit and reduce drift. How: Added `SHARED_RANKING_CONFIG`, `SEARCH_RANKING_CONFIG`, and `DISCOVER_RANKING_CONFIG` in `store.ts`; replaced hard-coded thresholds/weights in `searchClis`/`discoverClis` (semantic cutoffs, relevance weights, chain/infra thresholds, score floor, fallback multipliers, confidence cutoffs, trust divisor) with config references while preserving current behavior. Validation: `npm run test -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run lint -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/api` all pass. Files: `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Added explicit provenance/degraded-state signaling for homepage and split-screen terminal demos to prevent synthetic fallback data from appearing as live telemetry. How: Extended `HomeDemoSnapshot` with `source`, `usage_source`, `degraded`, and `fallback_reason`; changed fallback query behavior to use a stable sample query when usage stream is unavailable; surfaced provenance through `/api/home-demo` response payload and response header (`x-clime-demo-source`); updated homepage and split-screen terminal components to render `LIVE SNAPSHOT`, `LIVE SNAPSHOT (PARTIAL)`, `SAMPLE SNAPSHOT`, and `CONNECTION LOST` states consistently with muted indicators when not live. Files: `apps/web/lib/home-demo.ts`, `apps/web/app/api/home-demo/route.ts`, `apps/web/components/home-terminal-demo.tsx`, `apps/web/components/agent-split-demo.tsx`, `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Improved trust messaging and contributor guidance alignment for launch readiness. How: Added API health probing in web data layer and switched homepage stats label to `Registry Stats` when data is degraded, added explicit trend provenance legend on `/rankings` (`Measured` vs `Estimated`), and replaced generic template `AGENTS.md` with clime-specific product/governance instructions to remove repository intent ambiguity. Validation: `npm run lint -w @cli-me/web`, `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web`, `npm run build:web`. Files: `apps/web/lib/api.ts`, `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/rankings/page.tsx`, `AGENTS.md`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Enabled embedding-provider auto-selection so semantic retrieval can use true OpenAI embeddings by default when configured. How: Updated Postgres persistence to auto-select `openai` embedding provider when `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists (unless `CLIME_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` is explicitly set), preserving local hash-embed fallback behavior; updated `.env.example` to document optional override semantics instead of pinning local-only default. Validation: `npm run build -w @cli-me/api` passed; `npm run test -w @cli-me/api` currently has a known timeout in `test/persistence.test.ts` (20s timeout) unrelated to this change. Files: `apps/api/src/lib/persistence.ts`, `.env.example`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Applied a focused semantic-relevance polish to reduce weak short-slug auto-indexed noise in intent-driven search/discovery. How: Added explicit penalties and suppression gates for weak-evidence `auto-indexed` listings with short slugs in both `searchClis` and `discoverClis`, and added a regression test for payments-intent queries to ensure canonical results (e.g., `stripe`) are retained while weak short-slug noise is excluded from top results. Validation: `npm run test -w @cli-me/api -- test/discover-quality.test.ts` and `npm run build -w @cli-me/api` pass; full API suite still shows the known unrelated `test/persistence.test.ts` timeout at 20s. Deployment: pushed commit `f90bf8e` to `origin/main`, deployed Railway `api` service (`66c048a5-6ac9-4ae6-93e6-e4541d8bf95e`, SUCCESS), and verified `https://api.clime.sh/health` returns healthy plus live CLI search output for payments intent.
- [2026-02-18] What: Added explicit agent bootstrap flow to CLI so agents have a deterministic first-run setup path instead of guessing command order. How: Implemented `clime init [--agent]` in `packages/cli/src/index.ts` with JSON-safe bootstrap payload (`ready`, base URL, masked API-key state, next-step commands, optional `system_prompt`), refactored shared prompt text into `systemPromptText()`, and added first-run/help hint `clime init --agent --json`; key-generation hints are now suppressed in JSON mode for clean pipelines and shown in interactive mode. Updated docs and tests: added agent-bootstrap guidance to `README.md` and extended shell completion unit test coverage for the new `init` command. Validation: `npm run test -w @cli-me/cli`, `npm run build -w @cli-me/cli`, plus runtime sanity check via `node packages/cli/dist/index.js init --agent --json`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Prepared CLI release `@cli-me/cli@0.1.1` with agent bootstrap command (`init --agent --json`) and validated package quality gates. How: Bumped workspace version (`packages/cli/package.json` + `package-lock.json`), ran `npm run test -w @cli-me/cli` and `npm run build -w @cli-me/cli`, then attempted `npm publish --access public` from `packages/cli`. Result: publish blocked by npm auth (`Access token expired or revoked`, E401/E404 on scoped publish). Next step: refresh npm auth (`npm login` or new granular publish token) and rerun publish.
- [2026-02-18] What: Published `@cli-me/cli@0.1.1` to npm with the new agent bootstrap flow (`clime init --agent --json`). How: Re-authenticated npm via web login (`npm login --auth-type=web`), completed publish 2FA/web auth, successfully published from `packages/cli`, and verified registry metadata (`npm view @cli-me/cli version dist-tags --json` => latest `0.1.1`). Verified package runtime by executing `npx -y -p @cli-me/cli@0.1.1 clime --help`, confirming `init`, `system-prompt`, `completion`, JSON/format flags, and agent bootstrap help text are present.
- [2026-02-18] What: Improved homepage onboarding clarity so first-time visitors (especially agent users) see the required bootstrap order immediately. How: Updated hero copy to state install-first value proposition, changed Get Started command stack to `npm i -g @cli-me/cli` → `clime init --agent --json` → `clime search ... --json`, and rewrote How It Works steps so step 1 explicitly covers one-time clime install + agent init, followed by intent search and safe execution commands. Validation: `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web` and `npm run build -w @cli-me/web` pass (expected local API fallback warnings during static generation when 127.0.0.1:4000 is absent).
- [2026-02-18] What: Added dual onboarding lanes on homepage to clarify agent-first and human-first usage immediately after install. How: Added `Agent Path` and `Human Path` cards under Get Started with concise guidance + copyable commands (`clime init --agent --json` for agents, task search path for humans) and light card-specific spacing styles. Validation: `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web` and `npm run build -w @cli-me/web` pass (with expected local API fallback warnings during static generation when local API is absent).
- [2026-02-18] What: Removed duplicate command chips from homepage Get Started to reduce repetition after adding Agent/Human onboarding cards. How: Kept only install command (`npm i -g @cli-me/cli`) in the top Get Started command row and removed duplicated `clime init --agent --json` + `clime search ... --json` entries (those now live in the dedicated Agent/Human cards). Validation: `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web` and `npm run build -w @cli-me/web` pass (expected local API fallback warnings during static generation when local API is absent).
- [2026-02-18] What: Updated homepage hero subtitle emphasis styling per launch copy request. How: Wrapped phrase `agents and humans` in a dedicated emphasis span and styled it in accent color with bold weight (`.hero-subtitle-emphasis`) in global CSS to improve scannability without changing layout. Validation: `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web` and `npm run build -w @cli-me/web` pass (expected local API fallback warnings during static generation when local API is unavailable).
- [2026-02-18] What: Added Google Analytics gtag (`G-T54GHML18E`) site-wide in the web app root document. How: Injected the manual Google tag snippet in `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` `<head>` (async `gtag.js` loader + inline `gtag('config', 'G-T54GHML18E')`) so every page includes exactly one global tag instance. Validation: `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/web` and `npm run build -w @cli-me/web` pass (expected local API fallback warnings during static generation when local API is unavailable).
- [2026-02-18] What: Expanded checksum automation so `install --run` coverage can grow continuously with daily refreshes. How: Upgraded checksum refresh script to support `CLIME_CHECKSUM_REFRESH_SCOPE=top|all` and larger default batch size (`250`), added delta metrics (`newly_resolved_checksums`, `changed_existing_checksums`, `clis_with_checksum_updates`) for observability, wired a scheduled `checksums` worker into `infra/scripts/workers-runtime.mjs` (default 24h interval via `CLIME_CHECKSUM_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`), added root `npm run refresh:checksums`, and documented new env controls in `README.md` and `.env.example`. Validation: `npm run build -w @cli-me/api`, `npm run typecheck -w @cli-me/api`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Hardened checksum scheduler activation to avoid noisy failures in environments without database access. How: Added worker-runtime gating for the new `checksums` worker in `WORKER_MODE=all` so it only auto-runs when `DATABASE_URL` exists and `CLIME_CHECKSUM_REFRESH_ENABLED` is not set to `false`, plus startup logging for skipped workers. Validation: `node --check infra/scripts/workers-runtime.mjs`.
- [2026-02-18] What: Deployed checksum automation updates to production and validated real checksum persistence. How: Pushed `main` commit `7062790`, deployed Railway `workers` + `api`, set workers env controls (`CLIME_CHECKSUM_REFRESH_ENABLED=true`, `CLIME_CHECKSUM_REFRESH_SCOPE=top`, `CLIME_CHECKSUM_REFRESH_LIMIT=250`, `CLIME_CHECKSUM_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS=86400`), and executed production checksum refresh from API container (`railway ssh --service api ... npm run refresh:checksums -w @cli-me/api`) with sample batch result: `clis_processed=20`, `checksum_available_after=34`, `newly_resolved_checksums=34`, `clis_with_checksum_updates=19`.
- [2026-02-19] What: Stabilized iPhone/mobile viewport behavior to prevent visible page resizing/reflow during homepage load and terminal animation. How: Updated shared web CSS to use stable viewport sizing (`min-height: 100svh` fallbacking from `100vh`), clipped horizontal overflow at document level, normalized text-size adjustment for iOS, and constrained terminal/demo line containers so typing animation no longer expands page width (`home-terminal-body` + copy/typed line max-width/min-width fixes with contained horizontal overflow). Validation: `npm run build -w @cli-me/web` passed.
- [2026-02-19] What: Closed security/privacy review gaps for publisher-update authorization, API-key usage scope, CLI install binding checks, and deterministic JSON output metadata. How: (1) enforced publisher-owned API key ownership checks for `POST /v1/publishers/listings/:slug/update` (non-admin callers must present a publisher key matching `publisher_name`), (2) restricted `GET /v1/usage/by-key` so non-admin callers can only read their own key usage, (3) added npm artifact-binding verification before `clime install --run` executes checksum-backed npm-family commands, and (4) versioned CLI JSON envelope shape (`schema_version`, `command`) for safer agent parsing. Validation: `npm run -w @cli-me/api test -- api.test.ts`, `npm run -w @cli-me/cli test -- output.test.ts`, `npm run -w @cli-me/api typecheck`, `npm run -w @cli-me/cli typecheck`, `npm run -w @cli-me/api build`, `npm run -w @cli-me/cli build` all passed. Files: `apps/api/src/routes/v1.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/store.ts`, `apps/api/src/lib/persistence.ts`, `apps/api/test/api.test.ts`, `packages/cli/src/index.ts`, `packages/cli/src/output.ts`, `packages/cli/test/output.test.ts`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-19] What: Deployed API/workers with security hardening commit `29dcfeb` and verified live scope controls. How: Pushed `main` to GitHub (`7425ec0 -> 29dcfeb`), deployed Railway `api` and `workers` via `railway up --service <service> --ci`, then validated production endpoints: `/health` healthy, `/v1/usage/by-key` returns self-scoped usage for caller key, and cross-key query is blocked with `FORBIDDEN_API_KEY_SCOPE` for non-admin callers. Files: `LOG.md` (deployment/verification trace).
- [2026-02-19] What: Updated homepage agent-facing positioning copy to avoid anti-MCP absolutism and clarify optional integration path. How: Replaced the line "No MCP servers, no custom skills, no API wrappers." with "Works out of the box via shell commands. Optional MCP server included for tighter integration." in the homepage audience section. Validation: `npm run -w @cli-me/web typecheck` passed. Files: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, `LOG.md`.
- [2026-02-19] What: Refreshed benchmark artifacts from live production API so `/benchmarks` reflects current catalog scale and latency measurements. How: Re-ran `node infra/quality/run-context-benchmark.mjs` with authenticated API access (`CLIME_BENCHMARK_API_KEY=dev-local-key`) and regenerated `apps/web/data/context-benchmark.json`, `infra/generated/context-benchmark.json`, and `infra/generated/context-benchmark.csv` from current `/v1/clis` + `/v1/discover` responses (catalog now 845 CLIs in benchmark artifact).
- [2026-02-19] What: Moved Google Analytics configuration to environment-driven wiring for public-repo safety and deployment flexibility. How: Replaced hardcoded `G-T54GHML18E` script injection in web root layout with conditional render based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`, and documented the variable in `.env.example`.
- [2026-02-19] What: Added open-source governance baseline for public launch. How: Added `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml`), and PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) with contribution, moderation, and security-reporting guidance.
- [2026-02-19] What: Hardened contributor and public-export hygiene defaults. How: Expanded `.gitignore` to exclude generated artifacts/logs/local AI state and accidental local directories (`infra/generated`, local tool folders, debug logs), updated `lint-staged.config.js` to staged TS/JS eslint + JSON/MD/YAML prettier flows, and rewrote `README.md` with public-facing agent/human/publisher onboarding plus local docs hero image (`docs/assets/readme-hero.png`).
- [2026-02-19] What: Performed pre-public secret scan and triage. How: Installed `gitleaks` and ran `gitleaks detect --no-git --source .`; findings were confined to local build/generated artifacts (`apps/web/.next/*`, `infra/generated/*`) that are excluded from public snapshot/export paths.
- [2026-02-19] What: Executed clean public-repo migration to `sandroandric/clime` using allowlisted snapshot export (no private history leakage). How: Added deterministic exporter `infra/scripts/export-public-snapshot.sh`, cloned public repo, exported only approved paths (excluding `AGENTS.md`, product-overview/internal docs, generated artifacts), validated export with `gitleaks` (no leaks), and pushed snapshot commit `a668679` to `origin/main`.
- [2026-02-19] What: Corrected public snapshot packaging bug and completed production deploy from public snapshot. How: Fixed `.gitignore` root pattern (`/data/` instead of `data/`) so required runtime catalogs (`apps/api/src/data/*`, `apps/web/data/context-benchmark.json`) are included; re-exported and pushed fix commit `640edb1`; linked public checkout to Railway web service and deployed (`railway up --service web --ci`, deployment `94b25cb8-ea14-4999-9036-5bc53f14c068`), then verified live `/benchmarks` reflects updated artifact (`Catalog Size: 845`) and `https://api.clime.sh/health` remains healthy.
- [2026-02-19] What: Restored GA tracking after env-based migration by setting production web measurement ID and rebuilding. How: Set Railway `web` variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-T54GHML18E`, redeployed web from clean public snapshot (`railway up --service web --ci`, deployment `8f82fe66-53ef-4ac4-83ed-870d17cd54e7`), and verified homepage HTML includes the expected gtag loader/config calls.
- [2026-02-19] What: Reviewed public repository completeness and fixed public-facing instruction/link gaps for launch clarity. How: Verified governance/public files and templates are present in public `main`, added explicit `Agent Instructions` and `Developer Instructions` sections in `README.md` (with website + npm references and command paths), and updated website footer links to real public repo targets (`github.com/sandroandric/clime`) plus direct guide anchors (`#agent-instructions`, `#developer-instructions`) while preserving npm/blog/docs links.
- [2026-02-19] What: Aligned README hero image reference with user-provided file name for clarity. How: Added `docs/assets/readme_clime.png` from `/Users/sandroandric/Desktop/CLI/readme_clime.png` and updated README hero markdown to point to `docs/assets/readme_clime.png`.
- [2026-02-19] What: Fixed npm package metadata visibility for `@cli-me/cli` so npmjs can show README/license/keywords and package links correctly. How: Added package-level README (`packages/cli/README.md`), populated `packages/cli/package.json` metadata (`description`, `keywords`, `license`, `homepage`, `repository`, `bugs`, `files`), and bumped CLI package version to `0.1.2`.
